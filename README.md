## Description
This app was created to generate a SVG logo from the users choices. They can choose between different shapes(triangle,square, and  circle) .  In Addition the user can also choose their three letter logo , the color of the text for the logo, and the color of the shape.  All this can be choosen with color keywords and hexidecimal numbers. Please note is you do not enter a valid color keyword or hexidecimal number the app will not render.

## Installation
You will need to install node.js, jest and inquirer before getting started.(https://nodejs.org/en)

## Usage
Please enter node index.js into the terminal to get the app started. From here you will be asked a series of questions to create your shape.

Once you answered the prompt questions correctly the new shape will be created in the logos.svg folder.
